# Software

Software for the Funbox platform.

The Planet Series are what I would consider to be ready-to-go guitar pedals.
 - Mercury : An amp emulator running NAM neural amp modeler and 4 band EQ.
 - Venus   : A spectral reverb with string-like harmonies, detune, and freeze.
 - Earth   : A plate reverb with octave and overdrive effects.
 - Mars    : An amp sim including neural models and IRs, with a 3-mode delay.
 - Jupiter : A stereo reverb with tons of customization.
 - Saturn  : A stereo spectral delay that diffracts your signal into particles.
 - Neptune : A stereo reverb/delay capable of ethereal sounds.
 - Uranus  : A granular delay and FM synth.
 - Pluto   : A wacky Dual/Stereo Looper with speed/direction controls. 

"Experiments" includes tests that might be interesting, but are not necessarily a polished product.

The files in the "Template" directory serve as a starting place for developing your own effects.
