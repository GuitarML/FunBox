# Software

Software for the Funbox platform.

The Planet Series are what I would consider to be ready-to-go guitar pedals.

 - Mars: A amp sim including neural models and IRs, with a 3-mode delay.
 - Jupiter : A stereo reverb with tons of customization.
 - Neptune: A stereo reverb/delay capable of ethereal sounds.

"Experiments" includes tests that might be interesting, but are not necessarily a polished product.

The files in the "Template" directory serve as a starting place for developing your own effects.
